# k3rnelpfp
## This is in early alpha phase, expect bugs and crashes
Manually force change of profile picture by modifying system default user profile picture files primary made for KernelOS but works on all Windows Editions

necessary files:  
â€Ž `user.bmp`, `user.png`, `user-32.png`, `user-40.png`, `user-48.png`, `user-192.png` and `user-200.png`

1. grab your profile picture and rename it to `user.png` make another copy of it and rename it to `user.bmp`
2. make copies of your profile picture but that contain the width & height of number shown in the filename (ex: `user-200.png` so `200x200`)
3. **^** you can use a [image resizer website](https://retoucher.online/image-resizer)
4. move all those files and paste them into a directory
5. take the location of that directory and paste it into k3rnelpfp  (ex: `C:\Users\username\Documents\Profile_Pictures\pixelated_silly_cat`)
6. logout and you should see it changed now
