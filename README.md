## This is in early alpha phase, expect bugs and crashes
Manually force change of profile picture by modifying system default user profile picture files primary made for KernelOS but works on every Windows

â€Ž `user.bmp` is the original profile picture but .bmp, `user.png`, `user-32.png`, `user-40.png`, `user-48.png`, `user-192.png` and `user-200.png`

1. grab your profile picture and rename it to `user.png`
2. make copies of your profile picture that contain the width & height of number shown in the filename (ex: `200x200`)
3. **^** you can use a [image resizer website](https://retoucher.online/image-resizer), for the bmp file you can use [cloudconvert](https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-bmp) to change it to a `.bmp`
4. grab your copies and paste them into a Directory
5. take the location of the directory and paste it into k3rnelpfp
6. logout and you should see changed now
